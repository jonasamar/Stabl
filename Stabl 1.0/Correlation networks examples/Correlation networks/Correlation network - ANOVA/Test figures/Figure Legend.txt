Fig XX. Representation of the trajectories from (a.) the correlation network of the baseline CyTOF features for all timepoints on a t-SNE layout. Each node represents an immune feature of the CyTOF dataset, with both intracellular markers and frequencies of each cell type. The size of each node varies according to the p-value of the main effect of POCD calculated from an ANOVA. Edges represent a correlation coefficient R>0.7 between two features. Names of features which ANOVA p-value ≤ 0.01 are displayed in the correlation networks. Features are further clustered using k-means and the number of clusters is optimized using the silhouette score. For the clusters with the most statistically significant features (using p-value ≤ 0.01 as threshold), the aggregated vision of the cluster trajectory is displayed. The median of the trajectories is in solid line for healthy patients and in dotted line for POCD patients. Additionally, the filled areas in solid and dashed colours represent the interquartile of the trajectories for the healthy and POCD patients respectively. The represented features are coming from: (b.) cluster 5 trajectory plot which comprises mainly expression of pSTAT3 in CD4T and Myeloid derived cells, (c.) TBD (d.) TBD
