This file is here to explain the order in which one should run the multiple Rmd files (when values are equals it means it doesn't matter which one is first):

1 - Onset of Labor preprocessing
1 - Drug assay preprocessing

2 - Drug assay data visualization

3 - Onset of Labor curves classification
3 - Drug assay models

4 - Onset of Labor feature index

5 - Drug assay scores and visualization
